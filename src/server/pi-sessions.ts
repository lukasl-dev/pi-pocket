/**
 * Pi's sessions from the terminal, to continue in Pi Pocket. Pi keeps each in a JSONL file in its sessions folder
 * (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, a folder per project; or the one folder `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` or `sessionDir` in
 * Pi's settings names), and finds them all with `SessionManager.listAll`, as `pi -r` lists every folder's. Their files
 * are only read, never written: Pi's own loader mends a file whose last line is cut off, and a `pi` still running may be
 * writing that line.
 *
 * A session continues here as a copy of where Pi left it, its current branch. People get every message of it to read,
 * and Pi gets the context Pi itself builds from the file (`buildSessionProjection`): a compaction becomes Pi Durable's,
 * keeping the same messages, and a context edit edits the same message. Pi's system prompt, its extensions' state, and
 * its model changes stay behind; Pi Pocket's prompt and tools apply. Nothing Pi did runs again: a tool call that never
 * finished gets a result saying so (Pi's says "No result provided"). Where Pi would send a tool result whose call is
 * not there (a stray one, or one whose call a context edit took out), Pi Durable leaves it out, as providers refuse it.
