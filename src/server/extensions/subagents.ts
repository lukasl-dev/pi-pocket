/**
 * Persistent background subagents, after Pi Durable's example 23. One `subagent` tool spawns named subagents,
 * messages them, stops them, and lists them. Each subagent is its own conversation, so a user can open it, watch it
 * work, and talk to it. Their answers go back to the parent at its next pause: after a tool call, or, when it is idle,
 * a moment after. Answers that arrive meanwhile wait together, and go as one message, so many subagents cost the
 * parent one extra turn at most rather than one each, and its queue holds one message of theirs at a time.
 *
 * Everything survives a restart: anchors, reporters, and the courier that delivers reports are durable tasks, and
 * request IDs keep a restarted task from delivering a message or a report twice.
